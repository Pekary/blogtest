# CS231n笔记-Lec2  K-近邻、交叉验证与线性回归 

## K-近邻算法——找到K个与测试样例相近的训练集样例，然后投票决定测试样例所属类别

- 训练时间短，测试时间长，因此实践中几乎不采用。

- 可以采用L1距离或者L2距离。L2比L1对两个向量的差要求更严格（the L2 distance prefers many medium disagreements to one big one）。采用距离实际上会收到很大部分的背景影响，因此单使用距离是不够的。

- 适合低维数据时使用，其在处理高维数据时使用的距离不能直观体现出来，因此其不用于图像分类。

- 如何使用kNN:Summary: Applying kNN in practice

  If you wish to apply kNN in practice (hopefully not on images, or perhaps as only a baseline) proceed as follows:

  1. Preprocess your data: Normalize the features in your data (e.g. one pixel in images) to have zero mean and unit variance. We will cover this in more detail in later sections, and chose not to cover data normalization in this section because pixels in images are usually homogeneous and do not exhibit widely different distributions, alleviating the need for data normalization.
  2. If your data is very high-dimensional, consider using a dimensionality reduction technique such as PCA ([wiki ref](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis), [CS229ref](http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes10.pdf), [blog ref](http://www.bigdataexaminer.com/understanding-dimensionality-reduction-principal-component-analysis-and-singular-value-decomposition/)) or even [Random Projections](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/random_projection.html).
  3. Split your training data randomly into train/val splits. As a rule of thumb, between 70-90% of your data usually goes to the train split. This setting depends on how many hyperparameters you have and how much of an influence you expect them to have. If there are many hyperparameters to estimate, you should err on the side of having larger validation set to estimate them effectively. If you are concerned about the size of your validation data, it is best to split the training data into folds and perform cross-validation. If you can afford the computational budget it is always safer to go with cross-validation (the more folds the better, but more expensive).
  4. Train and evaluate the kNN classifier on the validation data (for all folds, if doing cross-validation) for many choices of **k** (e.g. the more the better) and across different distance types (L1 and L2 are good candidates)
  5. If your kNN classifier is running too long, consider using an Approximate Nearest Neighbor library (e.g. [FLANN](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/research/flann/)) to accelerate the retrieval (at cost of some accuracy).
  6. Take note of the hyperparameters that gave the best results. There is a question of whether you should use the full training set with the best hyperparameters, since the optimal hyperparameters might change if you were to fold the validation data into your training set (since the size of the data would be larger). In practice it is cleaner to not use the validation data in the final classifier and consider it to be burned on estimating the hyperparameters. Evaluate the best model on the test set. Report the test set accuracy and declare the result to be the performance of the kNN classifier on your data.

## 交叉验证

- 实际上交叉验证非常消耗资源
- 只有当验证集样例少的时候我们采用交叉验证

## 线性回归
